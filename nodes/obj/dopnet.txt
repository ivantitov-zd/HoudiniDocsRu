= Dop Network =

""" The DOP Network Object contains a dynamic simulation. """

The DOP Network Object contains a DOP simulation. Simulations can
consist of any number of simulation objects (which do not correspond to
Objects that appear in /obj). These simulation objects are built and
controlled by the DOP nodes contained in this node.

Simulation-wide controls are provided on this node, such as caching
options and time step controls. The entire simulation can also be
transformed using the Transform parameters of this node. Transforming a
simulation at this level does not affect the simulation at all. The
Transform is applied after the simulation occurs.

TIP:
    To improve the playback of cached fluids, increase the __Cache Memory__ on the __Simulation__ tab.

@parameters

Playback Simulation:
    Turns the DOP network into a player for simulation files.
    Enabling playback mode will cause the result of the DOP
    network to be given by the simulation files selected. The
    internal nodes of the network will be ignored.
    One way to create simulation files to play using this option
    is the [Output Node|Node:dop/output] inside the DOP network.

== Simulation ==

Reset Simulation:
    #id: resimulate
    Полностью очищает кэш симуляции. В момент просмотра сети DOP над вьюпортом с правой стороны будет активирована кнопка. Нажатие этой кнопки выполняет те же действия, что и нажатие кнопки Reset Simulation.

Display:
    #id: display
    Whether the simulation is displayed in the viewport.

Initial State:
    #id: initialstate
    The name of a file that is used as the initial state of the
    simulation. This file must be a simulation state file
    created by either a File DOP or a Dynamics Output Driver. If
    this parameter is set, then the DOP nodes inside this
    network are not processed on the first simulation timestep.

Timestep:
    #id: timestep
    Controls the length of a simulation timestep. Usually this
    value will be some multiple of a frame time, but it is not
    required. By specifying a larger timestep the simulation
    will run faster but will be less accurate and less stable.
    Smaller timesteps give better result but calculate more
    slowly.

Substeps:
    #id: substep
    The default timestep expression will use this parameter to
    control how many substeps the dop simulation should perform
    every frame.  This can be easier to adjust than working with
    the 1/$FPS parameter in timestep.

Offset Time:
    #id: timeoffset
    Specifies an offset in seconds between the simulation time
    for this simulation and the global time displayed on the
    playbar. If this parameter is set to 1, then this simulation
    will not start cooking until frame 25. At that global time
    of 1 second, the simulation time will be 0. Several
    expression functions such as `doptime` exist for converting
    from global times to simulation times and vice versa.

Start Frame:
    #id: startframe
    Выражение по смещению времени ссылается на этот параметр. Это позволяет установить время начала симуляции в кадрах, а не в секундах, что в некоторых случаях может быть более удобным. Если для начального кадра установлено значение 24, симуляция не начнется до 24 кадра. Обратите внимание, что если вы используете этот параметр, то переменные $SF и $F больше не будут ссылаться на то же время внутри симуляции.

Scale Time:
    #id: timescale
    Указывает множитель, который соотносит глобальное время с временем внутри симуляции для данной сети DOP. Значение больше единицы означает, что время симуляции протекает быстрее, чем глобальное время. Значение меньше единицы приводит к тому, что симуляция происходит в замедленном движении относительно глобального времени. Существуют несколько выражений функций, таких как `doptime`, для преобразования глобального времени в время внутри симуляции и обратно.

Max Feedback Loops:
    #id: maxfeedback
    When simulation objects using different solvers are made to
    be mutual affectors (such as a cloth object and an RBD
    object), this parameter controls the maximum number of
    iterations to perform while attempting to resolve the two
    solvers. Increasing this number in situations where
    different solvers are mutual affectors increases the ability
    of the simulation to reach a satisfactory result, but can
    increase the simulation calculation time.

    In the case of fluid simulations, since the fluid cannot adapt
    to the feedback forces that are applied, a value of 2 should
    be used rather than higher values.  Higher values will just
    make the fluid artificially stronger and take considerable
    time.

Enable Automatic Resimulation:
    #id: autoresim
    When any parameter inside a DOP simulation is changed, or
    when any referenced external node is changed, the cache of
    the simulation is marked as invalid. If this parameter is
    turned on, the next time the playbar is moved to reach a
    simulation time of 0, the cache will be cleared and the
    first simulation timestep will be recalculated. If the cache
    is invalidated while at a simulation time of 0, the initial
    state is recalculated immediately. If the current time is
    beyond time 0, then the most recent timestep will be
    recooked, and the cache beyond the current time will be
    cleared. But all prior timesteps will be left untouched
    other than to be marked invalid. If this parameter is off,
    the cache is marked as invalid in exactly the same way, but
    the cache is never cleared automatically. To recook a
    simulation in this mode, the Recook Simulation button on
    this parameter dialog or above the viewport must be used.

Provide Data Hints:
    #id: datahints
    Rules governing allowed simulation data relationships are
    stored in a files called dophints.cmd in the scripts
    directory. If this option is turned on, at the end of each
    timestep the simulation state is compared against the rules
    in that file. If any rules are broken, warnings are added to
    the appropriate DOP nodes. This can be very useful when
    learning to use DOPs or when debugging problems with a
    simulation. Turning this option off will improve the
    performance of your simulation by skipping this validation
    step at the end of each timestep.

Interpolate Display Data:
    #id: interpolate
    If the global time is set to a value that does not line up
    with a simulation timestep boundary, this parameter controls
    how the simulation should be displayed. If this parameter is
    turned off, the closest simulation timestep contents are
    displayed. If this parameter is turned on, the contents of
    the previous and next simulation timesteps are interpolated
    to create an approximation of the simulation as it would
    have actually been at the current time. This option allows
    the simulation to appear smooth in the viewport even if the
    simulation timesteps do not line up with the global frame
    times.

== Cache ==

Cache Simulation:
    #id: cacheenabled
    Активирует кэш симуляции. Если эта опция не включена, многие солверы не будут работать должным образом. Однако для очень больших симуляций выключение этой опции - лучший способ гарантировать наименьший возможный объем памяти для симуляции.

Compress .sim Files:
    Determines if .sim files written to disk for caching will be
    compressed.  Compression can reduce the size of the disk cache
    significantly, but can also increase the time to cache
    significantly.  If loading or writing to cache seems slow, try
    using blosc compressed .sim files or uncompressed .sim files,
    especially with fluid sims.

Allow Caching To Disk:
    If the maximum size of the cache in memory is reached, the
    DOP Network can either delete old cache entries to make room
    for new entries, or old entries can be saved to disk. If
    this option is on, the old cache entries are saved to disk
    and will be reloaded from disk if needed. This mode will be
    slower than simply throwing away the old cache entries, but
    it ensures that the entire simulation history is always
    available regardless of the in-memory cache size.

Cache to Disk in Non Interactive Sessions:
    In non-interactive sessions, such as hscript or hython, one
    may often not want the entire simulation history to be
    available.  Their default behavior is to ignore the Allow
    Caching to Disk and not cache to disk.  This behavior can be
    overridden with this toggle.  Saving old simulation states to
    disk can often become very expensive and, since one will not
    be scrubbing the playbar on the result, a waste of disk space.

Cache Substep Data:
    Some solvers perform their own internal subsampling of time
    to get better results. This option controls whether or not
    the substep data created during this internal subsampling
    should be kept as part of the cache, or discarded as soon as
    the simulation timestep has finished computing. Having this
    option on can be useful for debugging purposes, or if
    accurate display of sub-timestep data is desired. Using the
    actual substep data will give more accurate results that
    displaying interpolated data.

Cache Memory (MB):
    Specifies how much memory in megabytes can be consumed by the cache for
    this simulation. Once this limit is exceeded, old cache entries are
    either deleted or saved to disk to make more room, depending on the
    value of the Allow Caching To Disk parameter value above.

Timeless (No History):
    Each frame the simulation is started fresh as if it were the
    first frame.  This means $SF is always 1.  It also means,
    however, if the network consists of a File DOP with a $F based
    .sim file, only the current frame will have to be loaded,
    allowing for fast random access of baked simulations.  Note
    that when in this mode only one frame is kept in the cache.

Save Checkpoints:
    Normally when the Allow Caching to Disk is enabled and the
    simulation hits the memory limit, the simulation is saved to
    files in the temp directory.  While these are valid .sim
    files, they can be hard to manage. When this options is on,
    each frame is immediately cached to the specified directory.
    It is still kept in memory until the Cache Memory is hit, but
    at that point it is not saved to disk (since it's already on
    disk).  The advantage of checkpointing is that if a cache
    frame already exists DOPs will not cook that frame, even if the
    simulation has been reset. Instead it will load that frame.
    Further, it only needs to cook the frames after the last valid
    checkpoint frame before the requested frame.  So if you
    have cache_50.sim and try to cook frame 100, cooking can start
    at frame 50.

    Using save checkpoints is similar to using a File DOP in Automatic
    Mode.  However, when you try to jump to frame 50 with a File
    DOP it must load the first 50 frames.  With checkpoints it can
    skip this step.

Checkpoint Files:
    The file sequence to save the checkpoints to.  These are
    .sim files, loadable with the File DOP or File SOP.  The
    variable $SF must be used to specify the frame number - $F
    cannot be used because this is working in simulation space.
    $SF4 is also supported.

Checkpoint Trail Length:
    How much of a history to keep before the checkpoint files
    are deleted.  A value of 0 will never delete cache files.
    Otherwise, frames older than this value will be erased from
    disk.

    Note that only checkpoint files created by this session of Houdini
    will be deleted.  If you restart Houdini with an existent
    cache files, they will not be deleted.  This is done because
    you were likely restarting from a crashed location and will
    want to guarantee you can once again restart there if it
    crashes again.

Checkpoint Interval:
    The frame interval between checkpoints. Setting this to a
    value of 1 will save a checkpoint every frame. Setting this to
    higher values will save a checkpoint after every number of
    frames specified. For example setting this to 5 will save a
    checkpoint every 5 frames.

    This can be done to save disk space if you are running a large
    simulation.
